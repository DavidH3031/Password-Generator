## Password Generator by David H.

This is a small python script that will allow you to generate a password with different arguments allowing different options.

`-C or --captial` Will add capital letters in the generation.

`-P or --punctuation` Will add punctuation into the password generation.

`-D or --digits` Will add numbers into the password generation.

If you would like all of them with a 16 character password then it would look like this.
```
python main.py 16 -C -P -D
```

Output will look something like this.
```
########################################
